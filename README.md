# Tensorflow
This repo consists of me doing random things in tensorflow. Currently I've just followed the tutorials and made one neural network that solves one line of sudoku with a single missing number (sudoku_lines) and another neural netork that solves a full sudoku puzzle with a 2x2 subgrid structure (sudoku_2x2_nn)
